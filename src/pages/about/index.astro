          Claire teaches friendly, accessible yoga classes that focus on breath-led movement, sustainable strength, and finding a calm, steady mind. Her classes are suitable for complete beginners through to those returning to the mat.
        </p>
        <p class="text-text-light text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Every class is designed with care — whether it's a slow, soothing Gentle Flow, a strength-building Vinyasa sequence, or a foundations-focused Beginners session. Claire provides plenty of adaptations and extensions so everyone can work at their own level.
